# dacia
Dacia is a 2D strategy game, which is set in the Central European region of ancient Dacia, i.e. approximately modern day Romania.


The game is in the style of Age of Empires, but it includes some other new features, some of which are only available in the campaign mode, such as the ability to alter the manner in which the campaign goes depending on relations with foreign nations.
